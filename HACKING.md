# Development HOWTO

This document describes the development process we're following. It's required reading for anyone intending to contribute.


Dependencies
------------

Main dependencies:
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) — crossplatform media framework;
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) — video support;
* [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/downloads/OpenAL11CoreSDK.zip) — audio support;
* [Zlib](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm) — compression.

On Windows, the above dependencies are resolved automatically during the cmake phase.

On Linux they are usually part of distribution and you only need to install the development versions of SDL2, ffmpeg, openal and zlib libraries. E.g. on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg ffmpeg-devel
sudo apt-get install openal openal-devel
sudo apt-get install zlib zlib-devel
sudo apt-get install SDL2 SDL2-devel
```

On Mac you can install the dependencies from homebrew.

Additional dependencies:
* CMake 3.20.4+ (3.20.21032501-MSVC_2 from VS2019 won't work);
* Python 3.x (optional, for style checks).

Minimum required compiler versions are as follows:
* Visual Studio 2022;
* GCC 11;
* Clang 13.

The following IDEs have been tested and should work fine:
* Visual Studio (2022 or later);
* Visual Studio Code (2022 or later);
* CLion (2022 or later).


Building on \*nix platforms
---------------------------

This project uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system.
Use the following commands to clone repository and build (it is recommended to build in a separate directory as shown here):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth.git
$ cd OpenEnroth
$ cmake -B build -S .
$ cmake --build build
```

To compile x86 build on x86_64 platform you can pass `-m32` via compiler flags to cmake.
For example instead of just `cmake ..` above execute `CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" cmake ..`

You can also select platform dependent [generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) for your favorite IDE.


Building on Windows
-------------------

* Get git (`https://git-scm.com/download/win`) and Visual Studio 2022.
* Make sure you have Windows SDK v10.0.20348.0 or higher.
* Clone, fork or download the repo `https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth`.
* Setup Cmake:
  * either install standalone cmake from the official website,
  * or add Microsoft one (that's coming with the VS installation) to your PATH environment variable (e.g `c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\<edition>\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin`). 
* Open the folder in Visual Studio.
* Select build configuration (x32 or x64) and wait for CMake configuration to complete.
* Select startup item as `OpenEnroth.exe`.
* Run!

If you wish you can also disable autoresolving main dependencies by turning off `PREBUILT_DEPENDENCIES` cmake option and pass your own dependencies source, e.g. via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) integration.

__Be aware__ that Visual Studio has a bug with git submodules not syncing between branches.
So when checking out the branch or switching to different branch you may need to run the following command manually: `git submodule update --init`


Coding style
------------

For the C++ code we are following the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\
Source code is automatically checked against it and Pull Request will fail if you don't follow it.

To perform style check before pushing anything you can build `check_style` target. In Visual Studio you can do that by going to ***Solution Explorer → Change Views → CMake targets***. Right click and build `check_style`, errors will be listed in output.

We also follow some additional style preferences, as listed below.

Documentation:
* Documentation should be in doxydoc format with `@` used for tags, and starting with `/**` comment introducer.
* Documentation should be written in English.
* Please leave original function offsets intact. If you have a chance, move them to doxygen comments using `@offset` doxygen tag (e.g. `@offset 0xCAFEBEEF`).

Naming:
* Use `MM_` prefix for macro naming. Macro names should be in `SNAKE_CASE_ALL_CAPS`.
* Use `SNAKE_CASE_ALL_CAPS` for `enum` values. E.g. `ITEM_CRATE_OF_ARROWHEADS`, `ITEM_SLOT_RING6`.
* For naming enum values, prefix the name with the name of the type, e.g. `MONSTER_TROLL_1` for a value of `enum MonsterType`. For values that are then used in array bounds, put the `_FIRST`, `_LAST` and `_COUNT` right after the name of the type, e.g. `ITEM_FIRST_MESSAGE_SCROLL`.
* Use `CamelCase` for everything else.
* Type names should start with a capital letter. E.g. `IndexedArray`, `InputAction`, `PlatformLogLevel`. This applies to all types, including classes, structs, enums and typedefs, with certain exceptions as listed below.
* Method & function names should start with a lowercase letter. E.g. `Vec3::length`, `gridCellToWorldPosX`, `getCeilingHeight`.
* Variable names should start with a lowercase letter. E.g. `int monsterCount = level->monsterCount()`.
* Names of private members should start with an underscore to visually distinguish them from variables without having to spell out `this->` every single time. E.g. `_initialized = true`, where `_initialized` is a member field.
* Note that the above doesn't apply to POD-like types as for such types all members are public and are named just like ordinary variables.
* Exceptions to the rules above are STL-compatible interfaces, which should follow STL naming rules. So it's `value_type` for iterator value type, and `push_back` for a method that's adding an element to a container.

Code formatting:
* `*` and `&` in type declarations should be preceded by a space. So it's `char *string`, and not `char* string`.

Language features:
* Use `enum class`es followed by `using enum` statements instead of ordinary `enum`s. This provides type safety without changing the syntax. For flags, use `Flags` class.
* It's OK to use plain `enum`s if you really need to have implicit casts to integer types, but this is a very rare use case. If you're using `enum` values to index into some array, consider using `enum class` coupled with `IndexedArray`.
* Make your code speak for itself when it comes to ownership. If a function takes ownership of one of its parameters, it should take `std::unique_ptr` by value. If it allocates its result and passes ownership to the caller, then it should return `std::unique_ptr`.
* Use an `int` unless you need something else. Don’t try to avoid negative values by using `unsigned`, this implies many changes to the usual behavior of integers and can be a source of bugs. See a section in [core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#arithmetic) for more info. However, don't overdo it, use `size_t` for indexing into STL containers.
* We generally refrain from using namespaces, and we consider the approach where namespace hierarchy follows the directory structure an antipattern that might make sense in other languages (e.g. Java), but not in C++. Besides, OpenEnroth is a relatively small codebase and doesn't need the measures advocated by the Google style guide to prevent name clashes. Exception to this rule is `namespace detail` that you're encouraged to use to hide implementation details and to prevent cluttering of the global namespace.

There is a lot of code in the project that doesn't follow these conventions. Please feel free to fix it, preferably not mixing up style and logical changes in the same PR.


Code Organization
-----------------

OpenEnroth code is broken up as follows:
* `thirdparty` – this is where all external libraries go.
* `Utility` – generic utility classes and functions go here. Utility classes should be domain-independent (e.g. should make sense in a context of some other project) and should depend only on `thirdparty` libraries.
* `Platform` – our platform abstraction layer on top of SDL. Platform classes should also be reasonably domain-independent and should depend only on `Utility`.
* `Library` – collection of independent libraries that the engine is built on top of. Code here can depend on `Utility`, `Platform`, and other libraries in `Library`.
* The rest of the code is currently pretty tangled with each part depending on each other. This document will be updated once we have some progress there.

Our basic guidelines for code organization are:
* One `CMakeLists.txt` file per folder. There are exceptions, but those are not yet codified.
* One class per source file, with the name of the source file matching the name of the class. Exceptions are small structs, which are usually easier to pack into a single source file, and helper classes, which generally should stay next to the main class. Note that this guideline doesn't apply to source files that mainly declare functions.


Testing
-------
We strive for a good test coverage of the project, and while we're not there yet, the current policy is to add tests for all the bugs we fix, as long as the fix is testable. E.g. graphical glitches are generally very hard to test, but we have the infractructure to test game logic and small isolated classes.

Tests are not built by default, and you will need to set `ENABLE_TESTS` cmake variable to be able to build them. You can either use your IDE for that, or just run `cmake` with `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` from the command line.

Tests in OpenEnroth fall into two categories:
* Unit tests. These are a standard breed of tests, written using Google Test. You can see some examples in `src/Utility/Tests`.
* Game tests. If you're familiar with how testing is done these days for complex mobile apps, then you can consider game tests a variation of UI tests that's specific to our project. Game tests need game assets to run, and are currently **not** run in github actions.

Game tests work by instrumenting the engine, and then running test code in between the game frames. This code usually sends events to the engine (e.g. mouse clicks), which are then processed by the engine in the next frame, but it can do pretty much anything else – all of engine's data is accessible and writable from inside the game test.

As typing out all the events to send inside the test code can be pretty tedious, we also have an event recording functionality, so that the test creation workflow usually looks as follows:
* Load a save that reproduces the bug that you've just fixed.
* Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to start recording an event trace. Check logs to make sure that trace recording has started.
* Perform the steps that used to reproduce the bug.
* Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` again to stop trace recording. You will get two files generated in the current folder – `trace.json` and `trace.mm7`.
* Rename them into something more suiting (e.g. `issue_XXX.json` and `issue_XXX.mm7`) and create a PR to the [OpenEnroth_TestData](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth_TestData) repo. 
* Once it's merged update the reference tag in the corresponding [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/blob/master/test/Bin/GameTest/CMakeLists.txt#L21) in the main repo.
* Create a new test case in one of the game test files in [the game tests folder](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/tree/master/test/Tests).
* Use `TestController::playTraceFromTestData` to play back your trace, and add the necessary checks around it.

If you need to record a trace with non-standard FPS (e.g. if an issue doesn't reproduce on lower FPS values), set `debug.trace_frame_time_ms` config value before starting OpenEnroth for recording.

To run all unit tests locally, build a `UnitTest` cmake target, or build & run `OpenEnroth_UnitTest`.

To run all game tests locally, set `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` environment variable to point to the location of the game assets, then build `GameTest` cmake target. Alternatively, you can build `OpenEnroth_GameTest`, and run it manually, passing the paths to both game assets and the test data via command line.

Note that if you can't find either `UnitTest` or `GameTest` target in the target list of your IDE, this likely means that you haven't set the `ENABLE_TESTS` cmake variable as described above.

Changing game logic might result in failures in game tests because they check random number generator state after each frame, and this will show as `Random state desynchronized when playing back trace` message in test logs. This is intentional – we don't want accidental game logic changes. If the change was actually intentional, then you might need to either retrace or re-record the traces for the failing tests. To retrace, run `OpenEnroth retrace <path-to-trace.json>`. Note that you can pass multiple trace paths to this command.
